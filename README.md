## Spotahome Interview Test
 
This is my approach for solving the interview test given by Spotahome.  
The idea is to display a list of available rooms provided by their API by using React and following their style guide and wireframe.
 
### Instructions
 
Simply clone this repository and run:
```
npm install
npm start
```
 
### Considerations
 
I decided to use styled components with a central theme to hold all of the style guide values since I like working like that.  
Setting up new projects with this method is time consuming but provides good results in my opinion.  
I did not have all of the information like height, width, font size and font family but I just chose those myself.  
I used this tool to generate names of colors: like this http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color/#CF6A07
